This is a Django blog website created purely for education purposes. It is based on the tutorial "Django for Beginners" Chapters 7-8.

You should consider ways to further enhance the website. Specifically:

1. Setup a signup link on the landing page.
2. Change the layout of the pages.
3. Restrict the page so that only a logged in user can access the posts.
4. You may need to add the line CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ['https://localhost:8000&#39;] into settings.py if you are running in codespaces. 
Or you will need to add in CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [' https://localhost:8000 ']


Currently this site allows user registration and sign in.

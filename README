This is a project to build a blog website.
It is purely for education purposes. It is based on the tutorial "Django for Beginners" Chapters 7-8.

You should consider ways to further enhance the website. Specifically:

1. Setup a signup link on the landing page.
2. Change the layout of the pages.
3. Restrict the page so that only a logged in user can access the posts.

Currently this site allows user registration and sign in.

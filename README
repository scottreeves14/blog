This is a Django blog website created purely for education purposes. It is based on the tutorial "Django for Beginners" Chapters 7-8.

You should consider ways to further enhance the website. Specifically:

1. Setup a signup link on the landing page. Also setup a login link.
2. Change the layout of the pages. Use css to do this. You should consider using the bass.css file located in static/css.
3. Restrict the page so that only a logged in user can access the posts.
4. You may need to add the line CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ['https://localhost:8000&#39;] into settings.py if you are running in codespaces.  Or you will need to add in CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [' https://localhost:8000 ']

NOTE:
#####
The default database file has been changed in the settins.py. It is call "blog_database.sqlite3".
